Adding a new item
<p>
If you know about an ID which is not listed in the database, you are welcome
to submit a new entry.
<p>
To add it, browse to its parent entry, click on the <a href='$AC_URL$newitem'>add item</a> link
and enter the last part of the new ID (without the parent ID) together with its name.
For example, when you want to submit the PCI device <tt>1234:5678</tt> (vendor ID <tt>1234</tt>,
device ID <tt>5678</tt>) and the vendor <tt>1234</tt> already exists, go to the page of
that vendor and enter a new item with ID <tt>5678</tt> there.
<p>
If you want to change an existing entry, just <a href='$HELP_URL$newdiscuss'>post a discussion
item</a> instead.
<p>
You can also add a note to the name. The notes are distributed together with the ID's,
so they should be used only in important cases (for example to draw attention to the fact
that the ID was used by a different company due to a mistake).
<p>
If you want to comment on anything, feel free to post a discussion comment. (Unlike
the note, it is only kept for other people editing the lists, not distributed to
users.)
<p>
After you submit the change, it will wait for approval by an admin.

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
<em>There is a couple of simple rules you should obey:</em>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid generic names like "unknown network card", they are not
	likely to help anybody.
	<li>Prefer chip names over marketing names. If you know both,
	please include the marketing name in square brackets
	(e.g., "<tt>3c595 100BaseTX [Vortex]</tt>").
	<li>Do not repeat the name of the vendor in the name of the device.
	<li>Look at the names of similar devices and follow the same form.
	<li>Verify the kind of the entry: do not submit subsystems as devices,
	do not submit USB ID's to the PCI lists :-)
</ul>
<p>If you are not familar with the syntax of the ID's, please check the description:
<ul class='navigation'>
	<li><a href='$HELP_URL$pci'>PCI devices</a>
	<li><a href='$HELP_URL$pci_class'>PCI device classes</a>
</ul>

<h2>Approval</h2>
<p>
All submissions are checked by the administrators for errors. The admins either approve
the entry, or ask you to correct it or to provide more details. In cases of blatant
abuse (spam in comments etc.), they have the power to remove the entry completely.
<p>

<h2>Notification subscription</h2>
<p>
If the subscribe checkbox is checked, a notification on the new item will be created for you.
For more information about notifications look at <a href='$HELP_URL$notifications'>their documentation</a>.

<h2>See also</h2>
<p>
Once an item is submitted, it is not sealed for ever. You can <a href='$HELP_URL$newhistory'>discuss</a> existing items and suggest new names for them.
<p>
If you are interested in changes in some item (or in its whole subtree), you can let the system send you <a href='$HELP_URL$notifications'>notifications</a>.
