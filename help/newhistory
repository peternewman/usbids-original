Discussion
<p>
If you think some information here is wrong, you know better or want to say something about some item, you can enter discussion.
Browse to the item and click the <a href='$AC_URL$newhistory'>discuss</a> link.

If you do not want to alter current name or note, provide only text.
If you want to change name, provide that one too (in that case, you do not have to provide text, but it is recommended to say why you think the new version is better).
Changing note alone is not possible, you can change it with name only.
If you change just note, enter the same name as before.

You can request item deletion here, too.
